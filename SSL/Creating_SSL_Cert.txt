1. Create the config file so you don't have to go through the prompts

    add to file san.cfg:
        [req]
        distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
        x509_extensions = v3_req
        prompt = no
        [req_distinguished_name]
        C = US
        ST = CA
        L = SanDiego
        O = OTR_Enterprises
        OU = .
        CN = OTR_Enterprises
        [v3_req]
        keyUsage = critical, digitalSignature, keyAgreement
        extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth
        subjectAltName = @alt_names
        [alt_names]
        DNS.1 = localhost
        DNS.2 = localhost:443
        DNS.3 = https://localhost

2. Create the key and the cert via openssl

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt -days 600 -config san.cnf

3. Combine the 2 files so windows can read them

openssl pkcs12 -export -name “OTR_Enterprises” -out localhost.pfx -inkey localhost.key -in localhost.crt

4. Import it to windows trusted root certificates

    mmc.exe in explorer as administrator
    File --> add snap-in --> add --> computer account --> local computer --> finish
    Certificates --> trusted root Certs --> right click certificates --> follow the prompts and navigate to localhost.pfx file --> finish the import...

5. Also import it to trusted third party certs (not sure if this matters but I did it anyways)
